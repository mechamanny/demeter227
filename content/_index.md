# Welcome Traveler.

This is the space where I share my thoughts on programming, computing, and succeding in the tech field. Here is where combine my ~10 years of experience in the field with the 3 years I spent teaching programming to new learners. 

My goal is to create insightful content that helps guide you through the confusion you might experience while learning and also share what interests me.

Happy coding!~!
